    "text": "Edinburgh, located in southeastern Scotland, is the capital city of Scotland. It follows the development characteristic of most English cities, which is to gradually expand based on the original Old Town and develop the New Town (although it is called New Town, it is more than three hundred years old). Today, the city of Edinburgh develops outwards with the old Town and the New town as the core, especially extending to the southwest since the barrier to northward expansion was the lake and encircling marsh. In economic terms, Edinburgh today is primarily a service provider and the second largest travel destination in the UK. At the same time, as can be seen from its published 2030 plan, the Edinburgh government hopes to develop its northern coastal natural resources for further development of tourism at this stage. It is worth mentioning that the tourism landscape development project in the north of the country has had a government-led development plan since 2000, but due to various problems such as the financial crisis and defamation charges, its planning has been continuously shelved, and has been replaced by another similar plan, but this plan is still in the initial stage of establishment, there is still a lot of room for development. In addition, another focus of the Edinburgh government is the establishment of the blue and green network of the city, which is expected to complete the establishment of the blue and green network of the entire city of Edinburgh by 2030 and achieve the goal of zero carbon emissions, so as to effectively mitigate its heat island effect.\n\n5 Application\nIf we want to get a deeper understanding of this kind of problem, you can consider some quantitative indicators related to remote sensing, which may include some data related to climate change, population activity, and land north of Edinburgh over the past few decades. For example, the impact of tourism on the heat island effect of Edinburgh, the change trend of environmental resources in the northern coastal areas, the expansion of urban area in the north of Edinburgh, the growth of population and even the change of its composition, as well as the transformation of some land uses may also reflect the problems it is currently facing. 根据以上信息可知，在未来几年中爱丁堡的环保型旅游项目很可能成为其所需要的重点项目，因此\n\n\n6 Reflection\nThis kind of research on a city’s policy is undoubtedly complicated, because it needs to consider many factors. To be honest, at the beginning I read a lot of literature but still didn’t know where to start. But from what I’ve written so far, it would be much easier to focus on just a small part of the city, especially if that part is a little more independent than the rest of the city."

(GISBOX, n.d.)\nOne of the applications I am very interested in is the use of remote sensing technology to predict fires, especially mountain fires. In the American College Students Mathematical Contest in Modeling in 2021, I tried related content, such as how to use remote sensing drones to monitor fire situations and inform local fire brigades in time. This is obviously more mathematical and will use a lot of modeling knowledge, but in fact there is a lack of a lot of remote sensing data, such as the fact that there will be a relatively long period of temperature change before the open fire burns (Maffei, Lindenbergh, and Menenti 2021) and after it is extinguished(Sandal Erzurumlu and Yıldız 2024). If remote sensing technology can be used to detect such changes, it will make a great contribution to the fire prediction and prevention of its recurrence.(Gale et al. 2021)"

Honestly, I knew very little about remote sensing before this course, so I chose this course because I wanted to learn something completely new. This lecture gives me a general outline of remote sensing. I have dealt with a lot of data in my undergraduate study, and I was curious about data collection at that time. Unfortunately, how to collect raw data is not included in my undergraduate study, but from this lecture, I can see that this course is what I want to know. At the same time, it seems that this course can serve as a bridge between the data processing and modeling methods I learned before and the actual problem handling, and can transform the actual problems into more familiar data for further analysis. I hope this course will be of great help to the collection and search of data in my subsequent research."
