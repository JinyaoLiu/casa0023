    "text": "2.4 Scattering in action\nSunlight is scattered by particles in the atmosphere and smaller wavelengths scatter easier. Wavelength of visible light(from long to short): red, orange, yellow, green and blue.\nThus both sky and ocean seems blue in eyes for blue light has shorter wavelength and is easy to be scattered and reflected. But there’s no atmosphere on the moon so no scattering can happen, thus the moon have a black sky.\nSo clouds is a big problem in remotely sensing for it will affect the wavelength received by satellite. Use Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) to “see through clouds”."
