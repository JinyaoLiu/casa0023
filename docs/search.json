Waves are part of the EMR spectrum.\nEnergy carried by EMR waves = radiant energy\nEnergy per unit of time = radiant flux\nEnergy from the sun = incoming short wave radiation or shortwave radiation\nEnergy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time (from electromagnetic radiation) = solar irradiance (per unit time - flux)\nEnergy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time = Exitance (emittance) (per unit time - flux)\nFlux means time.\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength\nData formats \n\\[ \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{geosynchronous orbit (GSO) = satellite matches the Earth's rotation } \\\\\n\\text{geostationary orbit = holds same position, usually only for communications but some sensors are geostationary.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right. \\]"

    "text": "2.4 Scattering in action\nSunlight is scattered by particles in the atmosphere and smaller wavelengths scatter easier. Wavelength of visible light(from long to short): red, orange, yellow, green and blue.\nThus both sky and ocean seems blue in eyes for blue light has shorter wavelength and is easy to be scattered and reflected. But there’s no atmosphere on the moon so no scattering can happen, thus the moon have a black sky.\nSo clouds is a big problem in remotely sensing for it will affect the wavelength received by satellite. Use Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) to “see through clouds”."
