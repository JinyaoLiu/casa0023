# 1. Module aims

Operationalise remotely sensed Earth observation data for informing decisions on environmental hazards arising from a changing climate, specifically in relation to urban areas and future urban sustainability.

# 2. Summary

## Definition

Remote sensing: acquiring information from a distance(e.g. Landsat and Sentinel), achieved through sensors(Satellites, Planes, Drones, Phones and free standing on the ground or sea).

Waves of an electromagnetic field, travel through space and carry radiant energy = Electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Waves are part of the EMR spectrum.

Energy carried by EMR waves = radiant energy

Energy per unit of time = radiant flux

Energy from the sun = incoming short wave radiation or shortwave radiation

Energy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time (from electromagnetic radiation) = solar irradiance (per unit time - flux)

Energy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time = Exitance (emittance) (per unit time - flux)

Flux means time.

Rayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength

Mie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength

Non selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength

## Two types of sensors

## Electromagnetic waves

$$
\lambda = \frac{c }{v} 
$$
![Image 3](fig/week1/fig3.png) This kind of energy waves reflected by the surface.

## Scattering in action

Sunlight is scattered by particles in the atmosphere and smaller wavelengths scatter easier. Wavelength of visible light(from long to short): red, orange, yellow, green and blue.

Thus both sky and ocean seems blue in eyes for blue light has shorter wavelength and is easy to be scattered and reflected. But there's no atmosphere on the moon so no scattering can happen, thus the moon have a black sky.

So clouds is a big problem in remotely sensing for it will affect the wavelength received by satellite. Use Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) to "see through clouds".

## Interacting with Earth's surface

Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function(BRDF): Change view and illumination angles.
